                        <h2>What will you do with the items I buy in the store?</h2>
                        Your purchase (and any Gift Aid contribution) will be used to fund the purchase, transport and distribution of food in our Community Kitchen in Athens. Because we are a small, volunteer-led project all of your money will go directly towards funding ingredients, tea and cooking costs within the kitchen. There is no middle man and no diversion: 100% of the money raised will find itself to a plate on our table.<br><br>
                        
                        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
                        Khora Community Kitchen is part of Khora, a humanitarian co-operative association based in Athens, Greece. We are a group of experienced volunteers who have been working for other organisations around Europe focusing on the provision of services for refugees. We are responding to this humanitarian crisis that is affecting those forced from their homes by war, poverty and climate change.<br>
                        Food has always been at the heart of Khora. Our community centre, which was open for three years between 2015-2018, was created by a collective of individuals who had previously worked with community kitchens on Lesvos. The restaurant in the community centre continued this solidarity led approach to food provision, serving XX free meals per day to those using the building’s services. Our community kitchen is the newest chapter in this journey to rethink our approach to food distribution, and we’re excited to share the project with you.<br><br>
                        
                        <h2>Where are you from?</h2>
                        We are an international collective and our group changes frequently.  The current co-operative is made up of people from Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Belgium, Cameroon, Canada, Denmark, France, Greece, Germany, Iceland, Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Syria, the UK and the USA.  Some members of our group have freedom of movement but some do not. In the knowledge that this could create a difficult power dynamic within our community, we work to ensure that everyone is treated equally while acknowledging that some people have more pressing priorities than the daily work schedule.<br><br>
