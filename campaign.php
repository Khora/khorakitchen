                        Our online store is the virtual, fundraising counterpart to our restaurant in Athens. The concept behind this store is simple: you buy meals and ingredients online, we serve food for free in the café. We’ve all been told to finish our food because people are hungry, but it’s rarely clear how to bridge that gap between the abundance of food for some and its scarcity for others. Through our online store we want to make it easy for you to buy lunch for someone else who needs it. Thanks to being entirely staffed by volunteers and minimising our running costs, your money goes extremely far: one meal on your lunch break can equal a whole month worth of food for someone in Athens.<br><br><br><br>

                        Life in Athens for refugees and other vulnerable communities can be extremely difficult: negotiating the asylum claim system, finding housing, and caring for children are just some of the challenges people can face. Trying to find regular meals can make dealing with these needs feel like a constant fight just to survive. Furthermore, many displaced people arriving in Athens have experienced horrific food distribution lines in refugee camps on the islands, with people reporting spending up to 12 hours a day queueing for food that is sometimes moldy [source].<br><br><br><br>

                        This is why we created Khora Community Kitchen, a safe space where we create a thriving community atmosphere for people to enjoy their meals. We are a restaurant with a difference: not only are all the meals free, many of our co-ordinators, chefs and volunteers are from the community who eat here. This is an opportunity for people who worked in the hospitality industry in their country of origin to share their skills and continue their profession. We are built on the principles of love and respect and this creates the caring and lively atmosphere within the kitchen.<br><br><br><br>

                        Everytime you buy an item in our store you are helping provide this alternative food provision service. Coupled with our ‘Free Shop’, Khora is dedicated to providing refugees and others in need with their basic needs in a dignified and normal way.<br><br><br><br>
